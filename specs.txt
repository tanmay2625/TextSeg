x*cutoff 
img1.jpg=0.3
img2.jpg= 0.5
images need to be standardized
header and footer detection
connected words have more length hence cutted them in half and then applied djikstra

4 43 : increased weight while traveling from white to white so that the path is not deviated

as the text is not standardized we need to adjust the cutoff factor for every image
